                    <h2>Pre-work Week 4</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in
                            prework?</strong>
                        <br>
                        One thing I disliked about each of the new topics was how frustrating it was to learn everything
                        from
                        scratch. I had no prior knowledge of these
                        topics so it was a struggle trying to learn them, especially javascript.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What hindered your progress?</strong>
                        <br>
                        The one main thing that hindered my progress was when we got away from the hand holding on the
                        last
                        2
                        projects. It proved a little more of a challenge
                        to start the projects from scratch without really a framework that had already kind of been set
                        up
                        where
                        you just plugged stuff in.
                        <br>
                        <strong>How did you overcome challenges?</strong>
                        <br>
                        I was able to overcome the challenges through the use of the slack channel and the documentation
                        that we
                        have been referenced to. After going back through the stuff we had read
                        and just trying it out locally, I was able to figure it out and it all started to make more
                        sense.

                    <h2>Pre-work Week 3</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of
                            rendering content and providing user experience?</strong>
                        <br>
                        So far I have learned alot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their roles in creating and
                        modifying
                        web
                        content. It has been a whirlwind of information these past couples of weeks and I am excited to
                        continue
                        learing
                        and trying to incorporate each of them into my blog.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</strong>
                        <br>
                        I am still struggling to incorporate more CSS into my blog and I am just beginning to scratch
                        the
                        surface in JavaScript. I know the only way that I am going to get better at both of them is to
                        continue
                        practicing with them and "hacking" my blog in the hopes that it breaks. Having code break and
                        being
                        uncomfortable is a desired state apparently and I am definitely at that point.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pre-work Week 2</h2>
                    <p>
                        So for week 2 the main things I am struggling with is incorporating multiples pages into my blog
                        and
                        also CSS in general.
                        Before this bootcamp I had no other prior experience with any of the material we are covering so
                        it
                        is
                        all very new to me.
                        It is alot to learn so far but I am excited to continue learning and getting more familiar with
                        everything we have covered up to this point.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Pre-work Week 1</h2>
                    <p>
                        Week 1 was about what I was expecting maybe a little more involved. So far I am struggling with
                        the
                        command line and trying to learn to use it navigate through
                        everything we are doing. I am exciting to learn more about it and how to successfully use it
                        going
                        forward.
