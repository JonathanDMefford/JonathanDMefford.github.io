            <h2>Pre-work Week 1</h2>
            <p>Week 1 was about what I was expecting maybe a little more involved. So far I am struggling with the command line and trying to learn to use it navigate through
                everything we are doing. I am exciting to learn more about it and how to successfully use it going forward.</p>
