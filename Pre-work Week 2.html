            <h2>Pre-work Week 2</h2>
            <p>
            So for week 2 the main things I am struggling with is incorporating multiples pages into my blog and also CSS in general. 
            Before this bootcamp I had no other prior experience with any of the material we are covering so it is all very new to me.
            It is alot to learn so far but I am excited to continue learning and getting more familiar with everything we have covered up to this point.
