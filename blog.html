            <h2>Pre-work Week 3</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</strong>
            <br>
            So far I have learned alot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and their roles in creating and modifying web content. It has been a whirlwind of information these past couples of weeks and I am excited to continue learing
            and trying to incorporate each of them into my blog.
            <br>
            <strong>What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</strong>
            <br>
            I am still struggling to incorporate more CSS into my blog and I am just beginning to scratch the surface in JavaScript. I know the only way that I am going to get better at both of them is to continue
            practicing with them and "hacking" my blog in the hopes that it breaks. Having code break and being uncomfortable is a desired state apparently and I am definitely at that point.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Pre-work Week 2</h2>
            <p>
                So for week 2 the main things I am struggling with is incorporating multiples pages into my blog and also CSS in general. 
                Before this bootcamp I had no other prior experience with any of the material we are covering so it is all very new to me.
                It is alot to learn so far but I am excited to continue learning and getting more familiar with everything we have covered up to this point.
                </p>
            
            <h2>Pre-work Week 1</h2>
            <p>
            Week 1 was about what I was expecting maybe a little more involved. So far I am struggling with the command line and trying to learn to use it navigate through
            everything we are doing. I am exciting to learn more about it and how to successfully use it going forward.
